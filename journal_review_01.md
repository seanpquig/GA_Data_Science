##Journal Review 01

####*Objective/Abstract:*
The goal of this paper is to gain into insight into the causes and dynamics of crowd disasters.  The authors try to do this through a qualitative analysis of videos and public documents related to the crowd disaster that occurred at the Love Parade, a German music festival, in 2010.  The authors intend to provide a new perspective on crowd disaster dynamics, update a few commonly held misunderstandings, discuss the merits of citizen science, and give recommendations to prevent future incidents.  The paper takes on an exploratory mission and proposes no concrete hypothesis prior to analysis.
 
####*Style:*
The paper has a few potential audiences:

* Other academics and crowd researchers.  The paper clearly contributes to the general body of work in the academic field and questions some commonly held beliefs about crowd disasters.
* Public officials, police forces, and mass event organizers.  The paper recommends specific planning and preventative measures that could be used by this audience to more effectively fulfill their roles in event safety.
* Citizen scientists.  The work of these kinds players in voluntarily providing videos and compiling event information is applauded by the authors.  The paper could possibly be a way to acquaint them with the more academic research process, and further support their work. 

###*Methods:*
In their work the authors employ the following methods:

*  Analysis of a large body of public documents and video recordings to create an overview of events leading up to the Love Parade and a highly detailed chronological timeline of events on the day of the disaster.  This appears to be quite thorough and is unique in its ability to use crowd sourced video available only recently with the rise of internet video sharing.
*  A computer simulation employing the heuristic pedestrian model that predicts where the most dense, high force areas would occur in the crowd.  Its predictions of critical areas match up fairly accurately with where the majority of deaths and injuries occurred.
*  A detailed identification of the many factors contributing to the disaster.  Again, this seems to be fairly thorough.
*  An analysis of how these many factors interacted together and the construction of a complex diagram that shows their causal dependencies.  This really puts in perspective how certain factors caused a chain of higher order ones, eventually culminating in the improbable disaster.
*  Recommendations as to how such a disaster can be prevented through better event planning and execution.
*  The creation of a scale that measures the criticality of a crowd conditions.


While the methods seem very robust and effective in determining what exactly went wrong in at the Love Parade, the use of a single member sample makes me question how applicable the findings are for crowd disasters in general.

###*Conclusions*
I thought the paper did a very good job of analyzing the Love Parade disaster and accounting for the many factors that contributed and their mutual interactions.  It also convincingly disproved other assumptions or conclusions about what caused the disaster and the event's deaths specifically.  I thought the paper's organization was fairly straightforward.  It was easy to read and well written, aside from a small number of grammatical errors.

The one serious concern I have is how applicable the findings are to crowd disasters in general.  This only deals with a disaster caused by "crowd turbulence".  How effectively would these recommendations be in preventing other types of crowd disasters, such as stampedes or "mass panics"?  It is hard to say with the study's use of a single data point.
